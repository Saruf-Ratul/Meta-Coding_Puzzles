Given three integers AA, BB, and CC, determine their sum.
Your task is to implement the function getSum(A, B, C) which returns the sum A + B + CA+B+C.
Constraints
1 \le A, B, C \le 1001≤A,B,C≤100
Sample test case #1
A = 1
B = 2
C = 3
Expected Return Value = 6
Sample test case #2
A = 100
B = 100
C = 100
Expected Return Value = 300
Sample test case #3
A = 85
B = 16
C = 93
Expected Return Value = 194
Sample Explanation
In the first case, A + B + C = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6A+B+C=1+2+3=6.
